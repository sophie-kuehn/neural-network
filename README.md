## SNN - Sophie's Neural Networks

A command line application/library/server that trains and runs artificial neural networks.

```diff
- THIS IS A PROTOTYPE and does not yet include all the designated features!
```

## ToDo for 1.0

- add saving and loading of networks to/from files
- turn into an actual, argumented command line application
- split application into library + executable
- add server mode
